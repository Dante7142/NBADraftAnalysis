# NBADraftAnalysis
This project studies the success of NBA players drafted between the years 1995-2015 by showing their career success relative to their draft position. Using a variety of sources,  career points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks, turnovers, three point percentage, free throw percentage and field goal percentage averages were compiled for each of the players in the dataset. In order to evaluate pure performance without any draft position weight attached to it, a formula was created called PerformanceScore in which it incorporates all of the statistics we created into a formula that encompasses the entirety of a player's career. For each position( G,F,C), the stats are weighted differently using a regularized linear regression model in the PerformanceScore formula. Next, ExpectedScore was made, a score that shows us what a player drafted at a certain pick in the draft expected PerformanceScore should be. Finally, FinalScore was created, a combination of both PerformanceScore and ExpectedScore to get a ranking of every single player drafted from the year 1995-2015’s career success relative to their draft position. This analysis provides an insight into under and over achievers throughout this 20 year span while also being able to provide General Managers an understanding for the future on who to draft.
